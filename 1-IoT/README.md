The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. 
Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), Exhaust Vacuum (V) and the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.

We will use Azure Machine Learning Studio to create a model that can detect anomalies in that power plant data.

Then we will simulate new data from that power plant and see what's happenning on a Power BI report.
